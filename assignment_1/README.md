# CSCI 4229 Assignment 1
### Lorenz Attractor in OpenGL

### How to Use
 - run `make` or `make all` to build, `make clean` to remove binaries
 - `./main` to run openGL sim
 - there are instructions for opperating the simulation in the window, but the
     arrow keys alter the constants of the system.

### Time investment
NOT including the lectures, it took probably 4-5 hours, but this was mostly
reading about openGL, tinkering, and embarking on foolhardy endeavors that
didn't turn out to be that impressive.  To satisfy the bare minimum requirements,
having paid attention in lecture, I may have been able to achieve this in an
hour or less...  maybe...
