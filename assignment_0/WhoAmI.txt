1) Brandon Barrett

2) BA Computer Science, BA Philosohpy

3) Mostly 15" 2015 Macbook Pro, also Windows 10 desktop w/NVIDIA 700 series as well and Mint Linux on that same PC

4) Some work with highly abstracted libraries such as three.js throughout the course of my time as a web developer.

5) Interests vary greatly. The top ones (right now) in no partiular order are: 
  games 
  data visualization with an emphases on VR hardware
  music visualizers 
  work (data visualization) 
  my very own screen saver

6) Ideas for project:
  Infinite Staircase (not sure how viable this idea is)
  Basic music visualizer
  Interactive model/visualization of data that hasn't been visualized yet
  Cool mutating Screen Saver(s?)
  Any sort of game, but 1 month is a little tight for learning openGL and building a game with it while I also have a job and a kiddo.
